## Background

This was my first introduction to React and the first project using React as well. Understandably, there is a big learning curve with React and its syntax, but creating this component library enabled me to practice and feel more comfortable using React.

## How to Run

1. Preview the library with Storybook [here](https://trusting-goldberg-e512bc.netlify.com).
2. To install the library use the command `npm i component-library-Raymond-Nwambuonwo` in your terminal.
